    <p>Chimera aims to be a modern, general purpose Linux distribution.</p>
    <p>
        A major goal of the system is to break free from the common conventions
        of most Linux distributions and do its own thing. To achieve that,
        it seeks alternative solutions to various aspects of the stack.

    <h1>Alternative userland.</h1>
    <p>
        Chimera is not a GNU/Linux - its userland tools are based on
        FreeBSD, LLVM serves as the system toolchain, and <code>musl</code>
        provides the C library implementation.

    <h1>Clean and consistent.</h1>
    <p>
        Chimera aims to eliminate legacy cruft where possible to deliver
        a modern, general purpose, fully featured operating system that
        is simple but complete.

    <h1>Buildable from source.</h1>
    <p>
        While the system uses <code>apk-tools</code> and therefore binary
        packaging, it aims to be trivially buildable from source using a
        build system and package collection created from scratch.

    <h1>Portable.</h1>
    <p>
        You can use Chimera on all kinds of processors, including Intel/AMD,
        ARM AArch64, POWER and RISC-V. Architecture tiering system
        ensures optimal support.

            <strong>The distribution is in heavy development.</strong> Right
            now, it is a relatively complete graphical system with a multimedia
            stack and a web browser, capable of running Wayland and X11
            environments, such as GNOME and Enlightenment. However, it is still
            source-based (meaning you have to compile everything yourself) and
            undergoes frequent refactoring, so it is not yet safe to use.

            <strong>Initial bootable ISO images for x86_64 and ppc64le are now
            available.</strong> Check the <a href="/downloads">Downloads</a>
            page for links and instructions. Note that these are pre-alpha
            quality and are provided solely for testing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is currently planned that the distribution will stabilize once
            apk-tools has released a stable 3.x version. Chimera currently
            relies on a Git snapshot of apk-tools.
