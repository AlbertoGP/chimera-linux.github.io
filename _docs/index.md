Welcome to the Chimera Linux handbook.

Chimera is an independent, general-purpose, rolling-release Linux distribution
developed from scratch. It utilizes a FreeBSD-based userland, `musl` C library
and the LLVM toolchain, along with the `dinit` service manager. Its primary
focus is correctness, consistency and simplicity, but not at the expense of
feature set; its primary desktop environment is [GNOME](https://gnome.org).

The purpose of this documentation is to provide distro-specific information
in one place. You can help extend the documentation by contributing into our
[repository](https://github.com/chimera-linux/chimera-linux.github.io).
Keep in mind that it is not supposed to be a book about Linux in general.

Chimera is also a collaborative project developed by a small team of volunteers,
generally for fun and without monetary gain. Therefore, it relies on community
contributions to thrive.

The name refers to being made up of seemingly unrelated, incompatible pieces.
The logo represents our solid, stable building blocks and openness.
