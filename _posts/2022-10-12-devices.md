New images have been released today.

We now support a fairly wide variety of hardware:

* 64-bit x86 EFI and BIOS computers
* AArch64 computers capable of UEFI boot
* RISC-V computers capable of UEFI boot
* Select U-Boot-based AArch64 devices
* Select U-Boot-based RISC-V devices
* POWER architecture computers (POWER8+)
* Virtual machines for all of those

When provided with an external kernel and/or bootloader, Chimera
can be made to work even on other devices of supported architectures.

Specific non-UEFI AArch64 devices that are now supported are the
Pinebook Pro, MNT Reform 2 and Raspberry Pi 3/4/400, in addition
to virtualized qemu systems.

RISC-V has explicit support for the HiFive Unmatched in addition
to virtualized qemu systems (plain or OpenSBI).

The list of devices is subject to further expansion over time.
