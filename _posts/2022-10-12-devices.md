New images have been released today.

We now support a fairly wide variety of hardware:

* 64-bit x86 EFI and BIOS computers
* AArch64 computers capable of UEFI boot
* POWER architecture computers (POWER8+)
* Select U-Boot-based AArch64 devices
* Select RISC-V devices
* Virtual machines for all of those

When provided with an external kernel and/or bootloader, Chimera
can be made to work even on other devices of supported architectures.

Specific non-UEFI AArch64 devices that are now supported are the
Pinebook Pro, MNT Reform 2 and Raspberry Pi 3/4/400, in addition
to virtualized qemu systems.

RISC-V has explicit support for the HiFive Unmatched in addition
to virtualized qemu systems (plain or OpenSBI).

The list of devices is subject to further expansion over time.

Current immediate plans include generic UEFI ISOs for RISC-V (which
currently cannot be built because of unsupported relocations in GRUB)
plus additional popular AArch64 and RISC-V boards.
