There are some pre-alpha quality installation media available, alongside
experimental binary package repositories.

These include:

* Live ISO images
* Device images
* Root filesystem tarballs

Live ISO media and root filesystem tarballs are available for the following
architectures:

* `aarch64`
* `ppc64le`
* `riscv64`
* `x86_64`

Latest images are available [here](https://repo.chimera-linux.org/live/latest).
It is also possible to download some of the historical images, by visiting
the [parent directory](https://repo.chimera-linux.org/live).

The [installation](/docs/installation) section has more detailed information
about what is actually available and what you should end up using, as well
as how to use it.
